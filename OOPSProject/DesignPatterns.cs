/*  Design Patterns - 
 
    *   Design patterns are evolved as reuable solutions for the recurring problems that 
        occur everyday of programming.
    *   They are generally targeted at solving the problems of object generation and integration.
    *   These generalised patterns act as templates that can be applied to the real world problems.
    
    *   Types of Desin Patterns -
    
            1. Creational Design Pattern - This type deals with object creation and initiaization. 
               This pattern gives the program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created
               for a given case. 
               Ex. Singleton, Factory, AbstractFactory etc..

            2. Structural Design Pattern - This type deals with class and object composition.
               This pattern focuses on decoupling interface and implementation of classes and its objects.
               Ex. Adaptor, Bridge etc..
            
            3. Behavioural Design Pattern - This type deals with communication between classes and objects etc..
               Ex. Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter etc..
